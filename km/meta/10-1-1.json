The survey provides a comprehensive set of indicators on living conditions in Cambodia, covering main socio-economic areas such as housing conditions, health, education, labor force, economic activities, victimization, vulnerability and others. The survey questionnaire was asked for the household and for the household members. The sample size was determined for annual CSES is about 3,600 households. Every 5 years it is conducted with a big sample size is about 12,000 households. The last four big sample surveys were conducted in 2004, 2009, 2014 and 2019. However, this large sample survey has been conducted every two years started from 2021 onwards.</p><p>Since the CSES 2004, the diary method for collecting data on household expenditure/consumption and household income was introduced. As the recall method has been used in the previous rounds it was also decided to include in the recall modules. Thus, both methods are retained. The data collection was carried out throughout the whole calendar year, started from January to December. Face-to-face interview using the questionnaire was done and about 15 households per village were selected.  </p><p>The detailed documentations of the survey, such as questionnaire, filed operation annual and technical report on survey design and implementation are stored in NADA (National Data Archive), NIS website: <a href=\"http://nada-nis.gov.kh/index.php/home\">http://nada-nis.gov.kh/index.php/home</a>.</p>","COMPILING_ORG":"<p>National Institute of Statistics</p>","CONTACT_EMAIL":"<p><a href=\"mailto:saonith@gmail.com\">saonith@gmail.com</a> / <a href=\"mailto:sotheavuth@gmail.com\">sotheavuth@gmail.com</a></p>","CONTACT_FUNCT":"<p>Deputy Director of Department</p>","CONTACT_MAIL":"<p>No. 386 Street 360, Sangkat Boeung Kengkang I, Khan Chamkarmon, Phnom Penh,\u200b\u00a0Cambodia.</p>","CONTACT_NAME":"<p>Mr. Yim Saonith /Mr.Un Savin/ Mr. Sam Sok Sotheavuth</p>","CONTACT_ORGANISATION":"<p>National Institute of Statistics (NIS)</p>","CONTACT_PHONE":"<p>+855 12 626 726 / 11 388 889</p>","COVERAGE":"<p>Data availability by geographic location: national, urban, rural, and by ecological zones: Tonle Sap lake, plain, coastal, and plateau and mountain.</p>","DATA_COMP":"<p>The annualized growth of mean per capita real income or consumption is computed by first estimating the mean per capita real income or consumption computing the annual average growth rate.</p>","DATA_SOURCE":"<p>National Institute of Statistics</p>","DATA_VALIDATION":"<p>To align the global concept and definition, the applied average household size and the total of population has been used and the results in general are the same of household-based approach.</p>","FREQ_COLL":"<p>The next round survey: Qrt1, 2021</p>","INST_MANDATE":"<p>By virtue of the article 12 of Statistics Law, NIS in is responsible for:</p><ul><li>Collecting, processing, compiling, analyzing, publishing and disseminating basic data by conducting censuses and surveys, and utilizing administrative data sources;</li><li>Compiling national accounts and price indexes, as well as economic, environment and socio-demographic indicators;  </li><li>Coordination with line ministries as data producers as mandated by the Statistics Law; and</li><li>Functioning as the central repository of SDG indicators.</li></ul>","META_LAST_UPDATE":"<p>June 2020</p>","ORGANISATION_UNIT":"<p>Department of National Accounts, National Institute of Statistics</p>","OTHER_DOC":"<p>Cambodia Socio-Economic Survey Reports: <a href=\"https://www.nis.gov.kh/index.php/km/14-cses/12-cambodia-socio-economic-survey-reports\">https://www.nis.gov.kh/index.php/km/14-cses/12-cambodia-socio-economic-survey-reports</a></p>","QUALITY_MGMNT":"<p>The NIS decided to use statistical methods (calibration) to achieve better comparability between the different rounds of the CSES surveys by adjusting the samples to the population size and structure that was established by the national population census carried out in 2008.

The weights in CSES 2007 are adjusted by using the preliminary result from 2008 Population Census. Some provinces were excluded, due to cost and other reasons, in the sample for 2007. The estimates are however, adjusted for the under coverage error caused by excluding those provinces. A recalculation of the weights in CSES 2004 has been made for the coming analyses to obtain higher comparability between CSES 2004, and the surveys conducted from 2007 and onwards.</p>","REL_CAL_POLICY":"<p>One year after the reference period of the survey</p>","SDG_GOAL":"<p>Goal 10: Reduce inequality within and among countries</p>","SDG_INDICATOR":"<p>10.1.1 Growth rates of household expenditure or income per capita [10.1.1] (SI_HEI_TOTL)</p>","SDG_TARGET":"<p>Target 10.1: By 2030, progressively achieve and sustain income growth of the bottom 40 per cent of the population at a rate higher than the national average</p>","SOURCE_TYPE":"<p>Cambodia Socio-Economic Survey (CSES)</p>","STAT_CONC_DEF":"<p>The growth rate in the welfare aggregate of bottom 40% is computed as the annualized average growth rate in per capita real consumption or income of the bottom 40% of the income distribution in a country from Cambodia socio economic surveys (CSES) over a roughly 2-year period.
