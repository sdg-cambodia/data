SOURCE_TYPE: <p>Cambodia Demographic and Health Survey (CDHS)</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>The CDHS was conducted in 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2014. Before the CDHS,
  similar surveys known as Demographic Survey 1996 was also conducted by the NIS
  and followed by Nation Health Survey 1998 was conducted by Ministry of
  Health.</p>

  <p>The CDHS is national household survey covering many areas related to the
  demographic and health situation within the population. It includes
  information on demography, family planning, infant and child mortality,
  domestic violence, and health-related information such as breastfeeding,
  antenatal care, children’s immunization, childhood diseases, and HIV/AIDS.
  Also, the questionnaires are designed to evaluate the nutritional status of
  mothers and children and to measure the prevalence of anemia.</p>

  <p>The survey covered a sample of 15,000 plus households. All women age 15-49
  in these households and all men aged 15-49 in a sub-sample of one-half of the
  households were eligible to be individually interviewed. The questionnaire is
  conducted in three parts for household, women and men in the household
  supplemented by blood collection for HIV and hemoglobin testing. </p>

  <p>The CDHS data were collected by 17 teams, each consisting of a team
  supervisor, a field editor, and four female interviewers. Each team was in
  charge of data collection in one province or a group of provinces.
  Coordination and supervision of the interviewing activities were done by four
  survey coordinators and four supervisory staff members from the National
  Institute of Statistics and the Ministry of Health. Data collection took place
  over a six-month period, from February to July in the year of survey.</p>

  <p>The detailed documentations of the survey, such as questionnaire, filed
  operation annual and technical report on survey design and implementation are
  stored in NADA (National Data Archive), NIS website: <a

RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Anaemia is highly prevalent globally, disproportionately affecting children
  and women of reproductive age. It negatively affects cognitive and motor
  development and work capacity, and among pregnant women iron deficiency
  anaemia is associated with adverse reproductive outcomes, including preterm
  delivery, low-birth-weight infants, and decreased iron stores for the baby,
  which may lead to impaired development. Iron deficiency is considered the most
  common cause of anaemia, but there are other nutritional and non-nutritional
  causes. Blood haemoglobin concentrations are affected by many factors,
  including altitude (metres above sea level), smoking, trimester of pregnancy,
  age and sex. Anaemia can be assessed by measuring blood haemoglobin, and when
  used in combination with other indicators of iron status, blood haemoglobin
  provides information about the severity of iron deficiency. The anaemia
  prevalence for the population is used to classify the public health
  significance of the problem.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Despite the extensive data search, data for blood haemoglobin
  concentrations are still limited, compared to other nutritional indicators
  such as child anthropometry (1, 24); this was especially true in the
  high-income countries of the WHO European Region. As a result, the estimates
  may not capture the full variation across countries and regions, tending to
  “shrink” towards global means when data are sparse. Additionally, it was not
  possible to incorporate into the analyses some potentially important
  predictors of blood haemoglobin concentration, especially dietary iron and
  iron supplementation, because of limited data.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>Number of the anemic women aged 15-49 years divided by number of the total
  women aged 15-49 years.</p>

  <p>The anaemia status of women is assessed using blood haemoglobin
  concentrations. In surveys, blood haemoglobin concentrations are typically
  measured using the direct cyanmethemoglobin method in a laboratory or with a
  portable, battery-operated, haemoglobin photometer in the field that uses the
  azide-methaemoglobin method.</p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p>Data available based on CDHS 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2014.</p>

  <p>Data are available by age groups, sex, wealth, mothers' education
  geographic location (urban/rural) and by sub national and stratified estimates
  (e.g. sex, age groups, wealth, mothers' education, residence).</p>
