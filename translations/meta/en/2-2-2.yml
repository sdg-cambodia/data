  <p>Prevalence of wasting/overweight (weight for height >+2 standard deviation
  from the median of the World Health Organization (WHO) Child Growth Standards)
  among children under 5 years of age.</p>

  <p>The official MDG indicator is wasting as assessed using weight for height.
  Wasting can however also be assessed with mid upper arm circumference (MUAC).
  Estimates of wasting based on MUAC are not considered for the joint dataset.
  In addition, while wasting constitutes the major form of moderate acute
  malnutrition (MAM), there are acutely malnourished children who would not be
  picked up with weight-for-height or MUAC, namely those presenting bilateral
  pitting odema (characterized by swollen feet, face and limbs). For Surveys
  that report oedema cases, in the joint data set these are included in the
  prevalence of low weight-for-height.</p>
UNIT_MEASURE: <p>Percent</p>
SOURCE_TYPE: <p>Cambodia Demographic and Health Survey (CDHS)</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>The CDHS was conducted in 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2014. Before the CDHS,
  similar surveys known as Demographic Survey 1996 was also conducted by the NIS
  and followed by Nation Health Survey 1998 was conducted by Ministry of
  Health.</p>

  <p>The CDHS is national household survey covering many areas related to the
  demographic and health situation within the population. It includes
  information on demography, family planning, infant and child mortality,
  domestic violence, and health-related information such as breastfeeding,
  antenatal care, children’s immunization, childhood diseases, and HIV/AIDS.
  Also, the questionnaires are designed to evaluate the nutritional status of
  mothers and children and to measure the prevalence of anemia.</p>

  <p>The survey covered a sample of 15,000 plus households. All women age 15-49
  in these households and all men aged 15-49 in a sub-sample of one-half of the
  households were eligible to be individually interviewed. The questionnaire is
  conducted in three parts for household, women and men in the household
  supplemented by blood collection for HIV and hemoglobin testing. </p>

  <p>The CDHS data were collected by 17 teams, each consisting of a team
  supervisor, a field editor, and four female interviewers. Each team was in
  charge of data collection in one province or a group of provinces.
  Coordination and supervision of the interviewing activities were done by four
  survey coordinators and four supervisory staff members from the National
  Institute of Statistics and the Ministry of Health. Data collection took place
  over a six-month period, from February to July in the year of survey.</p>

  <p>The detailed documentations of the survey, such as questionnaire, filed
  operation annual and technical report on survey design and implementation are
  stored in NADA (National Data Archive), NIS website: <a

  <p>By virtue of the article 12 of Statistics Law, NIS in is responsible
  for:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Collecting, processing, compiling, analyzing, publishing and disseminating basic data by conducting censuses and surveys, and utilizing administrative data sources;</li>
    <li>Compiling national accounts and price indexes, as well as economic, environment and socio-demographic indicators; </li>
    <li>Coordination with line ministries as data producers as mandated by the Statistics Law; and</li>
    <li>Functioning as the central repository of CSDG/SDG indicators.</li>
  </ul>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Child growth is an internationally accepted outcome reflecting child
  nutritional status. Child wasting/overweight refers to a child who is too thin
  for his or her height and is the result of recent rapid weight loss or the
  failure to gain weight. A child who is moderately or severely wasted has an
  increased risk of death, but treatment is possible. Child wasting is one of
  the World Health Assembly nutrition target indicators.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>The CDHS estimates come with levels of uncertainty due to both sampling
  error and non-sampling error (e.g. mesasurement technical error, recording
  error etc.,). None of the two sources of errros have been fully taken into
  account for deriving estimates neither at country nor at regional and global
  levels.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>Survey estimates are based on standardized methodology using the WHO Child
  Growth Standards.</p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p>Data are available by age groups, sex, wealth, mothers' education
  geographic location (urban/rural) and by sub national and stratified estimates
  (e.g. sex, age groups, wealth, mothers' education, residence).</p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p>The standard analysis approach to construct the joint data set aims for a
  maximum comparability of country estimates. For the inclusion of survey
  estimates into the JME dataset, the inter-agency group applies survey quality
  assessment criteria. When there is insufficient documentation, the survey is
  not included until information becomes available. When raw data are available,
  and there is a question about the analysis approach, data re-analysis is
  performed following the standard methodology. Discrepancies between results
  from standardised approach and those reported may occur for various reasons,
  for example, the use of different standards for z-score calculations,
  imputation of the day of birth when missing, the use of rounded age in months,
  the use of different flagging systems for data exclusion. For surveys based on
  the previous NCHS/WHO references, and for which raw data are not available, a
  method for converting the z-scores to be based on the WHO Child Growth
  Standards is applied (Yang and de Onis, 2008). In addition, when surveys do
  not cover the age interval 0-<5 years, or are only representative of the rural
  areas, an adjustment based on other surveys for the same country, is
  performed. Any adjustment or conversion is transparently stated in the
  annotated joint data set.</p>
