  <p>The national poverty rate is the percentage of the total population living
  below the national poverty line. The rural poverty rate is the percentage of
  the rural population living below the national poverty line. Urban poverty
  rate is the percentage of the urban population living below the national
  poverty line.</p>

SOURCE_TYPE: <p>Cambodia Socio-Economic Survey (CSES)</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>CSES is conducted by NIS since 1993. The survey provides a comprehensive
  set of indicators on living conditions in Cambodia, covering main
  socio-economic areas such as housing conditions, health, education, labor
  force, economic activities, victimization, vulnerability and others. The
  survey questionnaire was asked for the household and for the household
  members. The CSES is conducted annually from 2007 to 2017. The sample size was
  determined for annual CSES is about 3,600 households. Every 5 years it is
  conducted with a big sample size is about 12,000 households. The last four big
  sample surveys were conducted in 2004, 2009, 2014 and 2019. From 2019 onwards
  the survey will be conducted biannually (every two years). </p>

  <p>Since the CSES 2004, the diary method for collecting data on household
  expenditure/consumption and household income was introduced. As the recall
  method has been used in the previous rounds it was also decided to include in
  the recall modules. Thus, both methods are retained. The data collection was
  carried out throughout the whole calendar year, started from January to
  December. Face-to-face interview using the questionnaire was done and about 15
  households per village were selected. </p>

  <p>The detailed documentations of the survey, such as questionnaire, filed
  operation annual and technical report on survey design and implementation are
  stored in NADA (National Data Archive), NIS website:
  http://nada.nis.gov.kh/index.php/home</p>

  <p>Monitoring national poverty is important for government development agenda,
  especially for monitoring the progress of National Strategic Development Plan
  and Royal Government Rectangular Strategy. National poverty lines are used to
  make more accurate estimates of poverty consistent with the country’s specific
  economic and social circumstances, and are not intended for international
  comparisons of poverty rates. </p>

  <p>Poverty is a multidimensional concept: The concept of poverty is applied to
  situations at both individual (or household) and country levels. From both
  these perspectives, poverty is a multidimensional approach. At the country
  level poverty is linked to the capacity of the economy to provide a central
  administration with sufficient resources to develop infrastructures, organize
  public services and implement development programs. Key economic factors that
  determine this capacity include: the level of economic activity, the state of
  the international market, and the currently exchange rate. While the first of
  these three factors can be directly affected by policy at national level, the
  latter two are closely related to the global economic context. In addition,
  social factors are also key determinants of the capacity of the economy to
  provide adequate resources to the central administration.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Comparisons of the results from the 2007 CSES with previous surveys in
  1993/94, 1996, 1997 and 1999, are not recommended due to differences in the
  survey design. Fieldwork from the last five surveys (2004, 2007, 2008, 2009
  and 2010) covered 15 months, and results can be reported for both 12 month
  (calendar year) and 15 month periods.</p>

  <p>The weights used in the reports from CSES 2004, are adjusted by using the
  preliminary population projections which give over estimated population
  counts. The weights in CSES 2007 are adjusted by using the preliminary result
  from 2008 Population Census. Some provinces were excluded, due to cost and
  other reasons, in the sample for 2007. The estimates are however, adjusted for
  the under coverage error caused by excluding those provinces. A recalculation
  of the weights in CSES 2004 has been made for the coming analyses to obtain
  higher comparability between CSES 2004, and the surveys conducted from 2007
  and onwards.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>The consumption level that separates the poor from the rest of the
  population is called the poverty line. The first step in calculating a
  consumption-based index to assess a level of consumption below which an
  individual will be defined as poor: the so-called poverty line. It is well
  known that if consumption is divided into two categories, food consumption and
  non-food consumption, the poorer people are, the higher the proportion of
  their overall consumption that is accounted for by food consumption. In
  determining consumption levels that can be used to separate the poor from the
  non-poor, food consumption is the most significant measure. Thus a food
  poverty line (a minimum level of food consumption) is first calculated. A
  non-food minimum allowance is then calculated and added to the food poverty
  line to provide the total poverty line.</p>

  <p>Once a poverty line has been set, a number of summary statistics describing
  the incidence, depth and severity of poverty may be calculated. These include
  the headcount index (which measures the incidence of poverty), the poverty gap
  (which measures the depth of poverty) and the squared poverty gap (which
  measures the severity of poverty). Foster, Greer and Thorbecke (1984) show
  that these three poverty measures may all be calculated using the following
  formula:</p>

  <p>The NIS decided to use statistical methods (calibration) to achieve better
  comparability between the different rounds of the CSES surveys by adjusting
  the samples to the population size and structure that was established by the
  national population census carried out in 2008. To mirror the rapid changes in
  the population, it proved necessary to project the population forwards to 2017
  and backwards to 1993, taking into account fertility, mortality and internal
  migration rates</p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p>The CSES is conducted by the NIS first time in 1993, followed by in 1996,
  1997, 1999, 2004, and conducted annually from 2007-2017. The CSES was
  conducted biannually (every two years) started from 2019 onwards.</p>
