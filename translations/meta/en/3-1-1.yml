  <p>The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) is defined as the number of maternal
  deaths during a given time period per 100,000 live births during the same time
  period. It depicts the risk of maternal death relative to the number of live
  births and essentially captures the risk of death in a single pregnancy or a
  single live birth.</p>

  <p>Maternal deaths: The annual number of female deaths from any cause related
  to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management (excluding accidental or
  incidental causes) during pregnancy and childbirth or within 42 days of
  termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the
  pregnancy, expressed per 100,000 live births, for a specified time period.</p>

  <p>Maternal death: The death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of
  termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the
  pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its
  management (from direct or indirect obstetric death), but not from accidental
  or incidental causes.</p>

  <p>Pregnancy-related death: The death of a woman while pregnant or within 42
  days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the cause of death.</p>

SOURCE_TYPE: <p>Cambodia Demographic and Health Survey (CDHS)</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>The CDHS was conducted in 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2014. Before the CDHS,
  similar surveys known as Demographic Survey 1996 was also conducted by the NIS
  and followed by Nation Health Survey 1998 was conducted by Ministry of
  Health.</p>

  <p>The CDHS is national household survey covering many areas related to the
  demographic and health situation within the population. It includes
  information on demography, family planning, infant and child mortality,
  domestic violence, and health-related information such as breastfeeding,
  antenatal care, children’s immunization, childhood diseases, and HIV/AIDS.
  Also, the questionnaires are designed to evaluate the nutritional status of
  mothers and children and to measure the prevalence of anemia.</p>

  <p>The survey covered a sample of 15,000 plus households. All women age 15-49
  in these households and all men aged 15-49 in a sub-sample of one-half of the
  households were eligible to be individually interviewed. The questionnaire is
  conducted in three parts for household, women and men in the household
  supplemented by blood collection for HIV and hemoglobin testing. </p>

  <p>The CDHS data were collected by 17 teams, each consisting of a team
  supervisor, a field editor, and four female interviewers. Each team was in
  charge of data collection in one province or a group of provinces.
  Coordination and supervision of the interviewing activities were done by four
  survey coordinators and four supervisory staff members from the National
  Institute of Statistics and the Ministry of Health. Data collection took place
  over a six-month period, from February to July in the year of survey.</p>

  <p>The detailed documentations of the survey, such as questionnaire, filed
  operation annual and technical report on survey design and implementation are
  stored in NADA (National Data Archive), NIS website:
