  <p>This indicator measures the number of people who died, went missing or were
  directly affected by disasters per 100,000 population.</p>

  <p><strong>Death: </strong>The number of people who died during the disaster,
  or directly after, as a direct result of the hazardous event.</p>

  <p><strong>Missing: </strong>The number of people whose whereabouts is unknown
  since the hazardous event. It<strong> </strong>includes people who are
  presumed dead, for whom there is no physical evidence such as a body, and for
  which an official/legal report has been filed with competent authorities.</p>

  <p><strong>Directly affected:  </strong>The number of people who have suffered
  injury, illness or other health effects; who were evacuated, displaced,
  relocated or have suffered direct damage to their livelihoods, economic,
  physical, social, cultural and environmental assets. Indirectly affected are
  people who have suffered consequences, other than or in addition to direct
  effects, over time, due to disruption or changes in economy, critical
  infrastructure, basic services, commerce or work, or social, health and
  psychological consequences.</p>

  <p><strong>Rationale and Interpretation:</strong></p>

  <p>The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 was adopted by
  UN Member States in March 2015 as a global policy of disaster risk reduction.
  Among the global targets, “Target A: Substantially reduce global disaster
  mortality by 2030, aiming to lower average per 100,000 global mortality
  between 2020-2030 compared with 2005-2015” and “Target B: Substantially reduce
  the number of affected people globally by 2030, aiming to lower the average
  global figure per 100,000 between 2020-2030 compared with 2005-2015” will
  contribute to sustainable development and strengthen economic, social, health
  and environmental resilience. The economic, environmental and social
  perspectives would include poverty eradication, urban resilience, and climate
  change adaptation.</p>

  <p>The open-ended intergovernmental expert working group on indicators and
  terminology relating to disaster risk reduction (OIEWG) established by the
  General Assembly (resolution 69/284) has developed a set of indicators to
  measure global progress in the implementation of the Sendai Framework, which
  was endorsed by the UNGA (OIEWG <a
  href="http://www.preventionweb.net/publications/view/51748">report
  A/71/644</a>). The relevant global indicators for the Sendai Framework will be
  used to report for this indicator. </p>

  <p>Disaster loss data is greatly influenced by large-scale catastrophic
  events, which represent important outliers. UNISDR recommends countries report
  the data by event, so that complementary analysis can be undertaken to obtain
  trends and patterns in which such catastrophic events (that can represent
  outliers) can be included or excluded.</p>

  <p>The NCDM is the coordinating body for all disaster management-related
  activities had established the structures of mechanism to respond to the
  disaster from national to local levels. It is also recognized as the primary
  agency for managing emergencies and building the resilience of communities to
  natural disasters. The other key mandates of NCDM include the implementing
  prevention and mitigation strategies to reduce the impact of disasters on
  life, livelihoods and infrastructure, issuing and recommending guidelines and
  policies for legislative ad budgetary support for emergency and disaster
  management. As a coordinating and policy recommending body, NDCM’s goal is to
  build an effective system for disaster prevention, effective disaster response
  and rapid disaster recovery.</p>

  <p>Roles and Responsibilities:</p>

  <h1>Manage data of disaster risk and develop report on the disaster situation;
  </h1>

  <h1>Proposal on reserves of resources for Disaster intervention in Emergency
  Response;</h1>

  <h1>Capacity Building and human resource development on disaster management;
  </h1>

  <h1>Coordination in implementation of disaster management policies; </h1>

  <h1>Exchange and sharing information; and </h1>

  <h1>Coordinate and mobilize resources for disaster response.</h1>

  <ul>
    <li>The NCDM is headed by the Prime Minister as president with membership comprising almost all ministers, as well as representatives from other government offices. A Secretariat coordinates all activities and serves as the point of contact for disaster management efforts and information.</li>

  <p>In most cases international data sources only record events that surpass
  some threshold of impact and use secondary data sources which usually have non
