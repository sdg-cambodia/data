COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>The CDHS was conducted in 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2014. Before the CDHS,
  similar surveys known as Demographic Survey 1996 was also conducted by the NIS
  and followed by Nation Health Survey 1998 was conducted by Ministry of
  Health.</p>

  <p>The CDHS is national household survey covering many areas related to the
  demographic and health situation within the population. It includes
  information on demography, family planning, infant and child mortality,
  domestic violence, and health-related information such as breastfeeding,
  antenatal care, children’s immunization, childhood diseases, and HIV/AIDS.
  Also, the questionnaires are designed to evaluate the nutritional status of
  mothers and children and to measure the prevalence of anemia.</p>

  <p>The survey covered a sample of 15,000 plus households. All women age 15-49
  in these households and all men aged 15-49 in a sub-sample of one-half of the
  households were eligible to be individually interviewed. The questionnaire is
  conducted in three parts for household, women and men in the household
  supplemented by blood collection for HIV and hemoglobin testing. </p>

  <p>The CDHS data were collected by 17 teams, each consisting of a team
  supervisor, a field editor, and four female interviewers. Each team was in
  charge of data collection in one province or a group of provinces.
  Coordination and supervision of the interviewing activities were done by four
  survey coordinators and four supervisory staff members from the National
  Institute of Statistics and the Ministry of Health. Data collection took place
  over a six-month period, from February to July in the year of survey.</p>

  <p>The detailed documentations of the survey, such as questionnaire, filed
  operation annual and technical report on survey design and implementation are
  stored in NADA (National Data Archive), NIS website:

  <p> Having a skilled attendant at the time of childbirth is an important
  lifesaving intervention for both women and babies. Not having access to this
  key assistance is detrimental to women's health because it could cause the
  death of the women or long lasting morbidity, especially in vulnerable
  settings.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Survey estimates come with levels of uncertainty due to both sampling error
  and non-sampling error (e.g. mesasurement technical error, recording error
  etc.,). None of the two sources of errros have been fully taken into account
  for deriving estimates neither at country nor at regional and global
  levels.</p>

  <p>The weights for each survey observation are determined by the sampling
  design, design weights, and adjusted for non-response and other imperfections
  such as under coverage or, adjusted to improve the precision of estimates.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>The number of women aged 15-49 with a live birth attended by skilled health
