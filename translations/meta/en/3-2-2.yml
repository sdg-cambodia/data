  <p>The neonatal mortality rate is the probability in the first month of life
  in the five or ten years preceding the survey, expressed per 1,000 live
  births.</p>

  <p>Neonatal deaths (deaths among live births during the first 28 completed
  days of life) may be subdivided into early neonatal deaths, occurring during
  the first 7 days of life, and late neonatal deaths, occurring after the 7th
  day but before the 28th completed day of life.</p>
UNIT_MEASURE: <p>Per 1,000 live births</p>
SOURCE_TYPE: <p>Cambodia Demographic and Health Survey (CDHS)</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>The CDHS was conducted in 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2014. Before the CDHS,
  similar surveys known as Demographic Survey 1996 was also conducted by the NIS
  and followed by Nation Health Survey 1998 was conducted by Ministry of
  Health.</p>

  <p>The CDHS is national household survey covering many areas related to the
  demographic and health situation within the population. It includes
  information on demography, family planning, infant and child mortality,
  domestic violence, and health-related information such as breastfeeding,
  antenatal care, children’s immunization, childhood diseases, and HIV/AIDS.
  Also, the questionnaires are designed to evaluate the nutritional status of
  mothers and children and to measure the prevalence of anemia.</p>

  <p>The survey covered a sample of 15,000 plus households. All women age 15-49
  in these households and all men aged 15-49 in a sub-sample of one-half of the
  households were eligible to be individually interviewed. The questionnaire is
  conducted in three parts for household, women and men in the household
  supplemented by blood collection for HIV and hemoglobin testing. </p>

  <p>The CDHS data were collected by 17 teams, each consisting of a team
  supervisor, a field editor, and four female interviewers. Each team was in
  charge of data collection in one province or a group of provinces.
  Coordination and supervision of the interviewing activities were done by four
  survey coordinators and four supervisory staff members from the National
  Institute of Statistics and the Ministry of Health. Data collection took place
  over a six-month period, from February to July in the year of survey.</p>

  <p>The detailed documentations of the survey, such as questionnaire, filed
  operation annual and technical report on survey design and implementation are
  stored in NADA (National Data Archive), NIS website:
  http://nada.nis.gov.kh/index.php/home</p>
FREQ_COLL: '<p>The next round survey: Qrt3, 2021</p>'

  <p>By virtue of the article 12 of Statistics Law, NIS in is responsible
  for:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Collecting, processing, compiling, analyzing, publishing and disseminating basic data by conducting censuses and surveys, and utilizing administrative data sources;</li>
    <li>Compiling national accounts and price indexes, as well as economic, environment and socio-demographic indicators; </li>

RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Mortality rates among young children are a key output indicator for child
  health and well-being, and, more broadly, for social and economic development.
  It is a closely watched public health indicator because it reflects the access
  of children and communities to basic health interventions such as vaccination,
  medical treatment of infectious diseases and adequate nutrition.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>The number of neonatal deaths divided by total number of live births and
  multiplies result by 1,000</p>
DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>While expanded in content the 2010 survey is a successor to the 2005, 2000
  and 2014 surveys and directly comparable.</p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p>Data disaggregation is available for various socio-economic characteristics
  including residence (urban/rural), household wealth quintiles, education level
  of the mother, maternal age, geographic regions (provinces).</p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p>The UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME)
  estimates are derived from nationally representative data from censuses,
  surveys or vital registration systems. The UN IGME does not use any covariates
  to derive its estimates. It only applies a curve fitting method to
  good-quality empirical data to derive trend estimates after data quality
  assessment. Whereas the country use a direct method is used based on a full
  birth history, a series of detailed questions on each child a woman has given
  birth to during her lifetime.</p>
